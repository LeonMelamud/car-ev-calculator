# EV Car Selection Calculator

This is a web application that helps users find the most suitable electric vehicle (EV) car based on their preferences and needs. The app provides a form where users can input their daily driving distance, region, and whether they have a home charger. Based on these inputs, the app will display a list of recommended EV cars.

The application also supports English and Hebrew languages, allowing users to switch between the two languages with a click of a button.
